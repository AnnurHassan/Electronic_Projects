# Arduino Radar Project
An Arduino-based radar system using positional Micro Servo and HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sound Sensor. The ultrasonic sensor is attached on top of the servo motor. The servo rotates 180 degrees from left to right and the SR04 checks for any object within the pre-determined distance. A buzzer is used to alert when an object is detected along with a led. The code for Arduino has been upladed above. A video of the project also above. Some Images below.

# PCB Design
Even though the project has been built completely on breadboard, I have made a custom PCB for this. I am still learning the concept of PCB therefore kept it very simple.

# Circuit Simulation
A Circuit Simulation has been done beforehand on a breadboard using [Tinker Cad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ii6DmvlBP4N-arduino-radar-with-servo)
