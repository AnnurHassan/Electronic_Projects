# Arduino Radar Project
An Arduino-based radar system using positional Micro Servo and HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sound Sensor. The ultrasonic sensor is attached on top of the servo motor. The servo rotates 180 degrees from left to right and the SR04 checks for any object within the pre-determined distance. A buzzer is used to alert when an object is detected along with a led.
